<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- ![](https://github.com/rsaz/Unity2D-Player-Movement/blob/master/PlayerMovementScreen.PNG) -->

Project created to demonstrate a generic saving system that can be used in any game:
Scripts:
- transform.Translate()
- transform.position
- rigidbody2d.velocity;
- rigidbody2d.addForce
- rigidbody2d.MovePosition()

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing rather than learning how to create your movement code for your game. You can take this code as a starting point. :smile:
